VS2017 (and higher) item templates have a different form (not zipped) and are located with the installer in NORMAROOT\VSIXInstall\VSIXOnly\ItemTemplates.

The corresponding templates are called ORMDatabaseImport_NoAssembly.vstemplate and the assembly name is injected as part of the VSIXOnly build.
